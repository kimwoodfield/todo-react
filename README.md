# todo-react

Quick Friday night project I put together because I was bored and because I thought it was about time I complete my write of passage by completing the famous todo list in react without referencing tutorial videos or anything, only reference was MDN and React docs (mainly just for a refresher on lifting state up).

Nothing flashy here whatsoever but a few obvious things I could implement if bothered would be - local storage for data persistence via the browser, light/dark mode, filtering, drag 'n drop etc
